## Scenes
### At the Laughing Bean
> The city of Neverwinter sits on the Sword Coast in the northwest of the continent of Faerun. Within the trade district, there is a tavern by the name of the Laughing Bean. Through a series of events both strange and mundane, it is here you find yourself, seated at the table of a boisterous red-haired dwarf by the name of Gundren Rockseeker. 
> 
> Gundren has been a casual acquaintance to you all and has asked you here to hear out a business proposition. But, as Gundren says, "talking business on an empty stomach is bad luck, and as you can see I'm a very lucky fellow!". Food and drink is brought to the table, so much so that you wonder if another four or five guests are expected. Even Gundren's dog, Rocky, has his own plate of food. 
> 
> Digging in to the food and drink Gundren starts the conversation, "So, my friends! I'm glad you've all made it here today. You all know me, but please, I beseech you, introduce yourselves to each other!"

Ask each player to introduce their character. During the character building you should have asked each player to think about how they would introduce themselves.

> "Excellent, excellent! I knew you'd all get along famously." Gundren wipes out his mouth with his signature purple scarf, embroidered with his family crest, a pickaxe and hammer crossed in front of a silver shield. The scarf was a gift from his wife along with a matching scarf for Rocky made by his youngest daughter.
> After you've all had some food and drink Gundren explains his business proposal. It seems he and his two brothers have discovered something big. Something that could change the fortunes of his and many other families. But, he needs help. He needs to take core of some business in Phandalin as soon as possible, but he also needs his copious supplies delivered to Phandalin. He has offered ten gold pieces each to escort the supplies, so he may ride ahead and attend his business without delay. 

There isn't much information that can be gleaned at this point.

### On the Road
> You’ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you’ve just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You’ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail. After about a half a day, you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.

Four goblins lay in ambush.
