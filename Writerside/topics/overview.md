# Overview

Lost Mine of Phandelver is an adventure for four to five characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 5th level. The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North â€” a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by wilderness and adventure.

## Background
Long ago there was a pact between the races of dwarves, gnomes, and humans to jointly benefit from the Wave Echo Cave which provided untold mineral and magical riches in the form of the Forge of Spells. Then orcs swept through the north of Faerun and the ensuing battle caused cave-ins that few survived and the location was lost.

Centuries have passed and the prosperous town that laid nearby has been revived from its abandonment as a frontier settlement. The Rockseeker brothers have recently discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to re-open the mines. However, a mysterious villain known as the Black Spider and his network of bandits and spies have followed the Rockseeker brothers to their prize, and now, he wants it for himself.

## Structure
Adventure is played out in four parts. Part 1 is the shortest and simply gets the characters to the town of Phandalin. The party starts from Neverwinter and is ambushed by Goblins along the way. This is where they will meet their first NPC, Sildar Hallwinter who will provide them with much of the background information they will need.

Part 2 starts in the town of Phandalin. The town is being controlled by a gang called the Redbrands for the last two months, led by Glasstaff. There are several quests available from various townsfolk, some of which will need to be done in order to find the location of Cragmaw Castle. There are also several factions present in the town, some of which can be joined.
